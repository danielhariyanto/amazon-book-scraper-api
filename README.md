# Amazon Scraper API

This API bypasses Amazon's bot detection to return scrapable HTML code for book products

Demo: https://limitless-atoll-52770.herokuapp.com/?bookString=PRODUCTNAME \n^change PRODUCTNAME to desired book that you would like to search

This will return scrapable HTML code for the most relevant book product from the search results
